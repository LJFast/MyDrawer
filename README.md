Repo for diverse things that does not fit elsewhere
I started to learn python, R and initial courses in AI, machine learning and deep learning via coursera, udacity and Matlab, plan to learn swift and maybe some basic in javacript as well as Stan and Octave
Put items here that are general but related to programming work in MOOC courses
